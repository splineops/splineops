Core API
========

The `TensorSpline` class is a sophisticated model designed for
multidimensional data interpolation using spline bases and extension modes.
It leverages the flexibility of tensor splines to handle complex data
structures, making it ideal for applications requiring precise interpolation
across multiple dimensions. The class supports various types of spline bases
and extension modes, which can be specified for each dimension, providing
extensive customization. Key features include strict validation of input
data and coordinates, automatic handling of grid-based and scattered data,
and the ability to compute and store interpolation coefficients for efficient
evaluation. The `TensorSpline` class is equipped with properties and methods
to access computed coefficients, spline bases, and extension modes, ensuring
a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for advanced interpolation tasks.
